# The slimbots framework

`slimbots` 0.3 is a discord.py-shaped framework, not just transport plumbing.
This is where the how-and-why lives, so docstrings in the code can stay one or two lines.
Read `bots/casino/` for a real bot built on it.

## Why the reversal

The pre-0.3 library was deliberately thin: no typed model, no cache, no event hierarchy.
Seven real bots later, every one of them had rebuilt its own regex command wall, its own member-lookup-by-name, and its own startup wiring.
That is the sign the abstraction was missing, not that each bot did something wrong, so 0.3 builds it once, in the library.

Every template in this repo is on `Bot` now; the pre-0.3 sync primitives (`Client`, `Connection`, `run_forever`, `cursor.bootstrap`/`sync`, `testing.FakeClient`) are gone entirely rather than kept around unused - see "Removed in 0.3.0" below.
`bot-ping` stays free of the library on purpose and never used them either; nothing else in the repo needed them once the port finished.

## Shape

```python
from slimbots import Bot, Member

bot = Bot(prefix="!")

@bot.command(aliases=["bal"], help="Show your chip balance")
async def balance(ctx):
    await ctx.reply(f"{ctx.author.display_name}: {wallet(ctx.author.storage_key)} chips")

@bot.command(help="Give chips to someone", cooldown=5)
async def give(ctx, amount: int, member: Member):
    ...

@bot.event
async def on_member_removed(frame):
    ...

bot.run()  # reads SLIMM_URL and SLIMM_BOT_TOKEN from the environment
```

`Bot(...)` owns config, auth, the websocket, reconnect with backoff, the `seq`-less full-roster refresh, command registration, graceful SIGTERM, and `run()`/`start()`.
A bot script imports `Bot` and little else.

## Commands

`@bot.command(name=None, aliases=(), help=None, usage=None, cooldown=None, cooldown_bucket="user", requires=None, check=None)` registers a function `async def name(ctx, *typed_args)`.
Arguments convert from the function's own annotations (`slimbots/commands.py`):

- `int` / `float` - parsed from one whitespace-separated token, or a clear `BadArgument` reply, never a traceback.
- `str` - one token, unless it is the *last* parameter, in which case it consumes the rest of the message (`!say hello there` -> `text="hello there"`).
- `Member` - resolved from `@username` or a bare username/id against `bot.space`, or a `BadArgument` naming the token that did not resolve.
- `Duration` - `10m`, `2h30m`, `1d` parsed to an int count of seconds (`slimbots/converters.py`); replaces a bot's own duration regex.
- `TimeOfDay` - `HH:MM` parsed to a `.hour`/`.minute` pair, range-checked; replaces a bot's own clock regex.
- A parameter with a default is optional; a missing required one raises `MissingRequiredArgument` naming it.

`help` is auto-generated from the registered set (name, aliases, usage, help text) unless a bot registers its own `help` command first.

`cooldown_bucket` picks who a `cooldown=` applies to: `"user"` (the default - each member gets their own timer), `"channel"` (one timer shared by everyone in that channel), or `"deployment"` (one timer for the whole bot, every channel). A `@group.command()` subcommand takes the same two keywords independently of its group's.

`@bot.check` registers an async predicate run before every command dispatch (a global cooldown/rate-limit rather than one command's own, for example): return a string to refuse with that reply, or `None`/falsy to let the command through.

`@bot.group(name=None, ...)` registers a command that dispatches its first argument token to a `@group.command(name=...)`-registered subcommand (`!remind in 10m text` -> the `remind` group's `in` subcommand), falling back to the group's own decorated function for a bare or unrecognised invocation.
This is what replaced every bot's own `TRIGGER_X = re.compile(...)` wall of shapes under one command name; `bot-reminders`' `!remind`/`!reminders` are the worked example.
`build_help_text` descends into a subcommand (`!help remind in`) the same way; command registration still counts a whole group as one entry, not one per subcommand (below).

A prefixed message naming no registered command is silent by default - it fires `on_command_not_found(ctx, error)` if, and only if, something is actually listening for it, so a stray `!` in ordinary conversation costs nothing (no author lookup, no `ctx` built) when nobody cares.
`error` is a real `CommandNotFound` (`error.invoked_with`, `str(error)`), not just a name string, for the same reason every other command failure is a real exception rather than a tuple.

## Identity

Store your own data under `member.storage_key` (an alias for the stable slim-m user id, never `username`, which can change).
Look a stored key back up to a live member with `await bot.space.member_for_key(key)` or `await bot.space.resolve_member(key)`, which fetches directly if the id fell out of the cached roster.
`await bot.space.find_member(user_id)` is the same cache-then-fetch but returns `None` instead of raising when the user is gone.
One line each way, by construction: neither name is spelled `id`, so a bot cannot casually key on the wrong field.

## The Space model

`bot.space` is `members`, `channels`, `roles` as live dicts, refreshed once per connect, kept current from the `channel.*`, `role.changed` and `member.role_changed` frames (a role change reloads the roles when the token may read them and re-derives every cached member's permissions; a member's role change refetches that member if it is cached), and reloadable on demand:

- `space.get_member(id_or_name)`, `space.get_channel(...)`, `space.get_role(...)`
- `await space.refresh_members()` / `refresh_channels()` / `refresh_roles()`
- `await space.grant_role(member, role)` / `revoke_role(...)` - real calls, not stubs, so a ported bot-roles hands out roles through the library.
- `Member.has_permission(permission)` checks the *caller's* base (deployment-level) permissions, the same set `GET /me` calls "base permissions", never the bot's own.
  `space.refresh_roles()` needs the bot's own token to hold `MANAGE_ROLES` (the same gate `GET /roles` has).
  Without it, every `has_permission` check answers `False`, deny by default, same as an unresolvable role-gated command anywhere else.

`on_member_join(member)` fires on a real `member.joined` frame - registration, or an existing account spending an invite code, never a restore (`on_member_restored` already covers that).
It is the one handler in this list that does not take a raw frame or an `events.py` payload: the frame carries only a `user_id`, so `Bot._handle_frame` resolves it to a live `Member` (`bot.space.resolve_member`, the same cache-then-fetch `_resolve_author` already does for a message's own author) before dispatching, which is why it lives as its own special case above `_GLOBAL_EVENT_FRAMES` rather than another entry in it.
`bot-greeter` is the worked example: a configured welcome message posted to a configured channel.

## Typed events

Every frame kind `frames.rs` defines gets an `@bot.event` handler now, not just the eight the framework already dispatched - `on_message_edited`, `on_message_deleted`, `on_reactions_changed`, `on_thread_updated`, `on_message_pinned`/`on_message_unpinned`, `on_poll_voted`, `on_presence_changed`, `on_profile_changed`, `on_typing_started`/`on_typing_stopped`, `on_channel_created`/`on_channel_updated`/`on_channel_deleted`, `on_category_changed`, `on_overwrite_changed`, `on_voice_activity`, `on_call_ringing`/`on_call_ring_ended`, the remaining canvas events (`on_canvas_objects_restored`, `on_canvas_cursor_moved`, `on_canvas_stroke_preview_updated`, `on_canvas_object_moved`, `on_canvas_object_reordered`, `on_canvas_media_slot_changed`), and `on_reports_changed`.
Each of these hands the handler a small typed object from `slimbots/events.py` (`event.channel_id`, `event.message`, and so on) instead of the raw frame dict - the eight pre-existing handlers keep getting the raw frame, unchanged, so a bot that reads `frame["user_id"]` today does not break.
`bot._handle_frame`'s own dispatch tables (`_GLOBAL_EVENT_FRAMES`/`_CHANNEL_EVENT_FRAMES`) now map a frame kind to `(handler_name, payload_class)`; `payload_class` of `None` means "pass the raw frame", which is how the eight originals stay backward compatible.
`on_member_join` is dispatched outside both tables, for the reason given above: its payload is an async-resolved `Member`, not something `payload_cls(frame)` can build.

Global versus channel-scoped follows the same test as before: an event about a channel's own activity (a message edit, a reaction, typing, canvas ops) is channel-scoped, gated the same way `message.created` is; an event about something that is not naturally inside one of a bot's watched channels - a member's presence, a channel being created in the first place, a DM call ring - is global, ungated by `channels`.
`Message.fetch()` (a single-message GET) and `on_voice_*` join/leave/screen-share events are deliberately not here yet: slim-m has neither route nor frame for them at the time of writing. Add them once those land server-side rather than guessing the shape now.

## The Canvas model

`Canvas(bot.client, channel_id)` wraps one channel's Voice Canvas: `await canvas.place(kind, x=, y=, w=, h=, props=)`, `move(object_id, x=, y=)`, `remove(object_ids)`, `clear(before_seq)`, `restore(target_op)`, `reorder(object_id, z_index)`, and `viewport(min_x=, min_y=, max_x=, max_y=)` for a bounded-rectangle read - `bot-canvas-board` is the worked example (a fixed-size sticky-note board).
`Canvas` was never tied to "the channel a command came from" - `channel_id` is just whatever you pass it, so a bot can take commands in one channel and draw on a different one's canvas without anything special. `bot.canvas(channel_id)` is the convenience form of the same thing: `bot.canvas(channel_id)` is exactly `Canvas(bot.client, channel_id, bot=bot)`, wired for the live gateway signals (`send_cursor`/`send_stroke_preview`) too, without repeating `bot.client`/`bot=bot` at every call site.
`clear`/`restore`/`reorder` are the same `POST canvas/ops` endpoint `move`/`remove` already use, just a different `kind` - `clear` needs MANAGE_CANVAS unconditionally and a `before_seq` fence (never optional, so a lost response retried without one cannot wipe an interval it should not); `restore` names a prior `remove`/`clear` op's own id, not an object id; `reorder` takes an explicit `z_index` the caller computes (typically one above/below every value it already knows, for "bring to front"/"send to back") rather than a server-computed delta.
`on_canvas_object_placed`, `on_canvas_objects_removed` and `on_canvas_cleared` are channel-scoped events - dispatched only for a channel in `channels`, the same gate `message.created` gets, since (unlike the member/role events) these carry a `channel_id` and are not deployment-wide.

## Voice

`await bot.voice.join(channel_id)` mints a token through `POST .../voice/token`, connects over LiveKit, and returns a `VoiceSession` that heartbeats itself as a `bot.background()` task for as long as it holds the room - `crates/slimm-server/src/voice/heartbeat.rs` evicts a participant whose heartbeat goes stale, so a bot that stops sending one is a bot that gets kicked. `session.can_publish` mirrors the caller's `SPEAK` grant, the same way a human's token does; `await session.publish_screen_share(width=, height=, sample_rate=, num_channels=, video_max_bitrate=, video_max_framerate=, audio_max_bitrate=, simulcast=, audio_queue_ms=)` publishes a video+audio pair tagged `SOURCE_SCREENSHARE`/`SOURCE_SCREENSHARE_AUDIO` - the same sources a person's own "share your screen" button publishes, so a client renders and plays a bot's stream on the call stage with no bot-specific code - and hands back the `VideoSource`/`AudioSource` a bot pushes its own decoded frames into. The three ceilings default to `None` (the library's own default for an unset `VideoEncoding`/`AudioEncoding`); `degradation_preference` is always set to `MAINTAIN_RESOLUTION`, since pre-recorded video reads worse blurry than a little choppy. `simulcast` defaults to `False`, where livekit's own default is on: a screen share's second layer is encoded at about 3 fps, and a client whose tile is smaller than the top layer is sent that layer, so a movie turns into a slideshow while the extra encode roughly doubles the CPU cost. `audio_queue_ms` sizes the `AudioSource` queue, which livekit defaults to 1000 ms: whatever is queued still plays after a bot stops feeding it, so a bot that seeks or pauses wants it short and calls `clear_queue()` on the source when it cuts to other audio. `await session.unpublish_screen_share()` takes the pair down again so a bot can republish at another size or ceiling (a `VideoSource`'s size is fixed once built). `await session.leave()` stops the heartbeat, disconnects, and forgets the heartbeat server-side; safe to call more than once.

The real work happens through `livekit.rtc`, loaded dynamically (`importlib.import_module`, not a static `import`) so neither pyright nor a bot that never touches voice needs the package installed - `bot-jellyfin`'s `!watch` (`stream_session.py`) is the worked example: Jellyfin transcodes server-side, a local `ffmpeg` decodes to raw frames, and those get pushed into the sources `publish_screen_share` returns at the source's own pace.

`await bot.voice.find_member(user_id)` answers "which voice channel is this person actually in right now", never "which channel did their command come from" - a command typed in a text channel has no voice call of its own, so a voice-aware command needs this rather than joining `ctx.channel_id`.
It prefers live state: `voice.participant_joined`/`voice.participant_left` (decision 0032, `{channel_id, user_id}`) update an in-memory cache as they arrive, ungated by `channels=` since presence needs tracking across every voice channel the bot can see, not just the ones it watches for commands.
A cache miss falls back to `GET .../voice/roster` on every voice channel the bot can see, fetched concurrently; a match populates the cache so a second lookup for the same person is free. These events only flow at all on a deployment with the LiveKit webhook configured (decision 0032's own caveat); the roster fallback is what keeps `find_member` correct regardless.
A member is in at most one call; if roster data somehow shows otherwise (no timestamp travels with it to say which is newer), the last channel checked wins, arbitrarily - the live-event cache is what actually resolves a genuine order between two joins, by recording when each one arrived.

## Config, settings, channel scoping, and durable cursors - all owned by Bot

`Bot()` reads `SLIMM_URL`/`SLIMM_BOT_TOKEN` itself, and `SLIMM_CHANNELS` (comma-separated ids) too when `channels=` is not passed explicitly - a bot script never needs `import os` just to read these three.
`Bot(require_channels=True)` folds a missing `SLIMM_CHANNELS` into the same one-line `RuntimeError` as a missing URL/token, instead of the bot re-checking it.
`bot.channel` is the lone configured channel when `channels` names exactly one - the common case for a bot that posts to one place.

`bot.setting(name, default=None, *, type=str, required=False)` reads one of a bot's *own* env vars the same way, converting via `type` (`int`, `float`, `bool`, `list` for a comma-separated one, or `dict` for comma-separated `key:value` pairs; a malformed pair is reported at `start()`) - `bot-jellyfin`'s nine `JELLYFIN_*` variables are the worked example.
A missing `required=True` value is never raised at the `setting()` call itself (which usually runs at import time, before `Bot.start()`); it is collected and reported together with a missing `SLIMM_URL`/token/channels in the same one-line error when `start()` runs.

## Where a bot listens, and how it is addressed

`channels=`/`SLIMM_CHANNELS` scopes which channels a bot reads.
A voice channel's chat is a separate channel with its own id, so a bot scoped to a text channel never sees it; `Bot(listen_voice_chats=True)` (or `SLIMM_LISTEN_VOICE_CHATS=1`) also accepts any voice channel's chat.
The bot still needs `VIEW_CHANNEL` there, and `SEND_MESSAGES` to answer.

Several bots in one channel would all answer `!help`.
Give each its own prefix with `SLIMM_PREFIX` (it overrides the `prefix=` the script passes), or address one by name with `@username <command>`, which every bot accepts unless built with `mention_commands=False`.
The default `help` header names the bot and shows both forms.

## Background tasks

`bot.background(coro, *, name=None)` is the one way a bot should ever start a loop that outlives one command - `bot-casino`'s hourly prune, `bot-reminders`' due-checker and pruner, `bot-jellyfin`'s poll loop.
A plain `asyncio.create_task(...)` is only weakly referenced by the event loop, so a fire-and-forget task like that can be garbage-collected mid-run and stop silently; `bot.background` stores the task in `bot._background_tasks` for as long as it is running, which is also what a shutdown walks to cancel every one of them cleanly.
An exception out of a background task (a 401 included, which stays terminal exactly like one on the socket) is treated as fatal: it is logged, the bot's main loop is cancelled, and `bot.run()` exits non-zero so a container orchestrator restarts it, rather than the task's failure going unnoticed while the rest of the bot carries on.
Call it from `on_connect`/`on_ready`, the same place a bot used to reach for `asyncio.create_task` directly.

`Bot(default_data_path="casino.db")` gives `bot.data_path`: `SLIMM_DB_PATH` if set, else that default - the one place a bot's own sqlite file path is derived, instead of every bot re-deriving `os.environ.get("SLIMM_DB_PATH", "...")` by hand.

A bot with `channels` set gets a persisted, cross-restart `seq` cursor for free, at `bot.data_path` when the bot has one (sharing the same file as its business data, the way `bot-casino` does) or a generic default (`slimbots-cursor.db`) otherwise; `Bot` bootstraps and `/sync`-replays the backlog through `process_message` on every connect, before `on_ready` fires - no bot code calls `cursor`/`catchup` directly any more.
The replay follows the server's `has_more` page by page until the backlog is drained, and a channel the server says is too far behind to replay (`reset`) skips ahead to its newest message instead of replaying anything.
`cursor_path=` on `Bot()` still exists to point the cursor at a file *other* than `data_path`, for the rare bot that wants them separate.

`on_raw_message(message)` still fires for every in-scope message, command or not - for a bot that wants its own hook into every message, not for cursor-keeping any more.
`on_frame(frame)` fires for every frame of any type, recognised or not, before any other dispatch - a liveness signal (a modlog-style bot marking itself "still connected") is the reason this exists; most bots have no reason to listen for it.
`slimbots.catchup`/`cursor` are still there for a bot that wants to manage its own separate cursor outside what `channels=` already covers, but neither is needed for the common case any more.

## The async store

`Bot(store_migrate=init_db)` opens `bot.store` automatically during `start()`, off the event loop, the same way `channels=` opens a cursor - most bots never need to call `open_store` by hand.
`await bot.open_store(migrate=init_db)` does the same thing directly: opens a `Store` at `bot.data_path` (or an explicit `path=`) and returns it as `bot.store`; calling it again just returns the same one.
`Store` owns a single sqlite connection but runs every query in a worker thread via `asyncio.to_thread`, one call at a time, so `await bot.store.run(get_balance, ctx.author.id)` never blocks the event loop the way a bare `bot.db.execute(...)` used to.
`migrate` is a plain `def migrate(conn): ...` run once, off the event loop, right after the connection opens - `init_db` in every bot that already had one.

The functions passed to `run()` are unchanged from before this - `get_balance(conn, user_id)`, `due_reminders(conn, now)`, and so on all still take a raw `sqlite3.Connection` and run synchronously; `run()` just moves *where* that call happens.
That is why `bots/casino/test_concurrency.py` did not need to change at all: it drives those same functions directly against its own real connections on real threads, never through `Bot` or `Store`.
A background sweep that already ran on its own thread (`bot-jellyfin`'s poster refresh used to reach for `asyncio.to_thread` by hand) can just call `bot.store.connection` directly instead, since it was never blocking the event loop in the first place.

## Migrating an existing table

`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` only ever creates a table that does not exist yet - a bot's own DB file carried over from an older release keeps its old columns forever unless something adds the new ones.
`slimbots.migrations.ensure_columns(conn, table, columns)` is that something: `columns` is `{name: "TYPE [NOT NULL DEFAULT ...]"}`, and it adds whatever the table is actually missing, one `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` per column, safe to call on every `init_db` (a column already there is left alone).
Call it after the `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for that table, inside the same `migrate` function passed to `Bot(store_migrate=...)`, the way `bot-reminders` and `bot-canvas-board` do for their own added columns.

`ensure_columns` cannot widen a `PRIMARY KEY` - SQLite's `ALTER TABLE` has no way to change one on an existing table, only add nullable-or-defaulted columns to it.
A column that needs to join the primary key (`bot-casino`'s `hands.hand_index`, added alongside real multi-hand support) needs the table rebuilt instead: rename the old table, create the new one, `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` the old rows across with a value for the new key column, drop the old table.
`bots/casino/blackjack.py`'s `_migrate_legacy_hands_table` is the worked example - it only runs when the table exists without `hand_index`, so it is a one-time rebuild, not something every `init_table` call redoes.

## Async HTTP

`slimbots.http.AsyncClient` is built on `httpx.AsyncClient` rather than `asyncio.to_thread` over `urllib`.
A bot's steady state is awaiting the websocket, and httpx gives real connection pooling and a timeout that composes with the rest of the event loop, instead of parking a thread-pool worker per in-flight request for something that is I/O-bound anyway.
httpx was already a transitive dependency in this environment, so it costs nothing new to vet.
`call()` retries a 429 or 5xx with exponential backoff (slim-m sends no `Retry-After`) and never retries a 401/403/other 4xx - a certain outcome, not an uncertain one.
`raw_body=` sends bytes as-is instead of JSON-encoding `body`, for an attachment upload (`bot-jellyfin`'s poster re-hosting is the worked example).

## Typed REST wrappers

`AsyncClient.send()` returns a `Message` now, not a raw dict: `await msg.edit(content)`, `await msg.delete()`, `await msg.react(emoji)`/`remove_reaction(emoji)`, `await msg.pin()`/`unpin()`, `await msg.vote(option)`, `await msg.open_thread()` (returns a `Channel`).
`bot-roles`' listing-message edit and `bot-jellyfin`'s poster upload used to be a raw `bot.client.call("PATCH", ...)`/`call("POST", "/attachments?...", raw_body=...)` - both are the named wrapper now (`edit_message`/`upload_attachment`).
`AsyncClient.upload_attachment(data, filename=)` returns an `Attachment` whose `.id` is exactly what `send`'s `attachment_ids` takes, so there is no raw dict in between.
`AsyncClient.list_dms()`/`open_dm(user_id)`/`close_dm(user_id)` wrap the DM routes, each returning (or listing) a `DmConversation`; a DM's `channel_id` works with every ordinary channel route, `send` included.

Every one of these is still a thin, hand-written wrapper over one REST call rather than a generated client - it is not route-shaped, it is "one class with the actions people actually reach for bound to it".

## Sending over the gateway

`typing`, `canvas.cursor` and `canvas.stroke_preview` are client->server frames, not REST calls - slim-m's own rate limits and authorization for them mirror the REST routes they stand in for, but there is no request/response, just a frame sent into the open socket.
`await bot.send_frame(frame)` sends one, raising a clear `RuntimeError` rather than hanging if nothing is connected yet; `await bot.start_typing(channel_id)` is the one-line form.
`async with ctx.typing():` is the one most commands want: it sends the initial frame on entry and refreshes every four seconds (slim-m's typing TTL is six) for as long as the block runs, so a slow command's typing indicator does not lapse partway through - `ctx.typing()`'s refresh loop is a plain, locally-scoped task cancelled on exit, not a `bot.background()` task, since nothing about it needs to outlive one command.
`Canvas(client, channel_id, bot=bot)`'s `send_cursor(x, y)` and `send_stroke_preview(object_id, points, ended=)` need that `bot=` (a clear `RuntimeError` otherwise) since they go over the gateway, not REST - the REST-only methods (`place`/`move`/`remove`/`clear`/`restore`/`reorder`/`viewport`) never needed it and still do not.

## Waiting for a reply

`await bot.wait_for(event, check=, timeout=)` waits for the next dispatch of an `on_*` event (a typed one from the previous section included) where `check(*args)` is true, or raises `asyncio.TimeoutError`; it registers and removes a temporary listener under the hood, so it composes with a bot's real `@bot.event` handlers rather than replacing them.
`await ctx.confirm(prompt, timeout=30)` is the one most commands want: it replies with `prompt` plus `(yes/no)`, waits for the same author's next message in the same channel via `wait_for("on_raw_message", ...)`, and returns `True`/`False` - a timeout answers `False`, the safe default for anything a confirmation is guarding.
`bot-canvas-board`'s `!board clear` is the worked example: it used to require retyping `!board clear yes` to confirm; it now asks and waits for a real reply.

`_handle_frame` runs each `message.created` frame's `process_message` as its own `bot.background()` task rather than awaiting it inline, precisely so a command's own `wait_for`/`ctx.confirm` can be answered at all: the gateway loop is a single sequential `async for frame in gateway.frames(): await self._handle_frame(frame)`, so an inline await would block that loop inside the command, and the very reply frame a `wait_for` is waiting for would never be read until the wait's own timeout fired - a deadlock, not a race, for any command that waits on a later frame in the same connection. `process_message`'s own error handling (`_invoke` catches and replies to `CommandError`/`ApiError`/any other `Exception`, re-raising only a revoked-token `ApiError`) already narrows what can escape a message's task to the one case `bot.background()`'s fatal-on-exception policy should apply to, so no new exception handling was added - the fix is only where the coroutine is scheduled. Task *creation* order still matches frame arrival order (the loop spawns one task per frame before reading the next), but task *completion* order is not guaranteed - a slower command finishes after a faster later one. A per-channel queue was considered and rejected: serializing a channel's messages to completion before the next would reintroduce the same deadlock one level down, since a command's `wait_for` blocking its own channel's queue can never dequeue the very reply that would resolve it.

## Splitting a bot across files

`bot.load_extension(module)` imports `module` (a name, or an already-imported module object) and calls its `setup(bot)` once - loading the same extension twice is a no-op the second time, keyed by module name.
An extension is a plain module with a `setup(bot)` function that declares commands and events the same way `bot.py` itself does, just against the `bot` it is handed instead of a module-level global:

```python
# economy.py
def setup(bot):
    @bot.command(aliases=["bal"], help="See your balance")
    async def balance(ctx):
        ...
```

An extension module should never import the bot's own entry-point module (`bot.py`) - most of these bots are run as `python3 bot.py`, which makes `bot.py` `__main__`, not an importable module named `bot`; anything that then does `import bot` loads and re-executes a second, separate copy of it instead of reusing the running one.
Shared logic (constants, sqlite helpers, pure functions) that both the entry point and its extensions need belongs in its own small module that neither depends on the other to import - `bot-casino`'s `casino_core.py` and `blackjack.py` are the worked example.

## Safeguards, and how to opt out

All from PR #6's primitives, now built in rather than something a bot must remember to call:

| Safeguard | Default | Opt out |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ignore other bots/webhooks | on | `Bot(ignore_bots=False)` |
| Never answer yourself | always on | not optional - see building-bots.md |
| Per-command cooldown | off | only set if `cooldown=` is passed |
| Permission gate | off | only set if `requires=` is passed |
| Input bounds/quotas | opt-in helpers | `slimbots.limits` - `require_len`, `require_range`, `require_int`, `Quota` |
| 403 from the bot's own missing permission | caught, replied clearly | a command can catch `ApiError` itself for a bespoke message |
| 401 (revoked token) | terminal, stops the process | not optional |
| 429 | exponential backoff, no crash | not optional |
| SIGTERM | clean shutdown, exit 0 | not optional - docker sends it on every redeploy |

Bot/webhook authorship (`slimbots/authors.py`) is resolved from the cached roster first and `GET /users/{id}` only as a fallback.
The one case that needs it is a webhook, which never appears in `GET /members` at all.

## Command registration

`@bot.command` registers itself with the server automatically, on every connect: `PUT /bots/commands` with `{prefix, commands: [{name, description, usage?, permission?}]}` (`slimbots/registration.py`), a full bulk overwrite each time, per decision 0031 in slim-m.
Every alias is registered as its own composer entry alongside its command's name, each truncated to the server's caps (name 1-32 `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`, description 1-100 chars, usage at most 80, at most 50 entries total).
A `@bot.group()` still contributes exactly one entry, whatever it names, not one per `@group.command()` subcommand - its `usage` is the subcommand names joined by `|` instead, so a bot with several grouped shapes cannot blow past the cap the way registering every subcommand separately would.
A `requires=` permission becomes the entry's single-bit `permission`, which only hides the row in the composer for a caller who lacks it - it is never enforced against the message a bot receives, so the command's own `requires=` check still runs.
A 404 or 405 is treated as "server too old" and skipped quietly; any other error (400 naming the violated cap, 403 if the token somehow isn't a bot's) is raised, so the framework works against today's production server exactly as it will against tomorrow's.

## Private replies

`await ctx.reply_ephemeral("you need Manage Server for that")` answers only the author of the message being handled: they see it marked "Only you can see this", on every device, and nobody else does, moderators and the bot's own socket included.
It calls `POST /channels/{channelId}/ephemeral-messages` (slim-m decision 0037), also available as `bot.client.send_ephemeral(channel_id, in_reply_to_id, content)`.
The recipient is the author of the message you answer, so it works for a command someone just typed and cannot reach anyone else. That message must be a person's, in that channel, no more than 15 minutes old, and addressed to your bot (it mentions you, replies to one of your messages, or starts with your registered prefix and one of your registered commands), or the server answers 403. You get three per message; the fourth is a 429.
Nothing is stored: it has no seq, never shows in history, search or sync, is gone on reload, and a member who is offline when it is sent never sees it. Use it for a refusal or a confirmation, not for anything they must not miss.
It may carry an `embed` and `attachment_ids`, but a private message cannot make a new file fetchable, so an attachment must already be visible to both the bot and the member (for example a file on a message in that channel) or the server answers 400. `content` may be empty when either is given, except on a server that predates this, which refuses an empty one.
A member who blocked the bot still gets a 200 back, so a bot cannot tell.
On a server that predates it the call is a 404 or 405 and raises `ApiError`; pass `public_fallback=True` to reply in the channel instead. Only do that for a refusal - never for anything private like a balance.
`FakeAsyncClient` records each one in `client.ephemerals`, separate from `client.sent`.

## Buttons

A message can carry buttons (slim-m decision 0039): `await bot.client.send(ctx.channel_id, "Hit or stand?", components=rows([Button("Hit", "hit", style="primary"), Button("Stand", "stand")]))` (`ctx.send` takes no `components`, so go through the client).
`Button(label, custom_id, style=..., disabled=...)` takes a style of `primary`, `secondary` or `danger`; `Button.link(label, url)` opens a page and never reaches the bot.
The caps are the server's and Discord's: 5 rows of 5 buttons, an 80-character label, a 100-character `custom_id` unique within the message.
`Button` refuses an over-cap value before the send, and only a bot may send buttons at all.

`@bot.button("hit")` runs `async def hit(interaction)` when a member presses that `custom_id`; `@bot.button(prefix="vote:")` matches a family of them.
The interaction names who pressed (`user_id`, `user_display_name`), the pressed `message_id` and its own `id`.
A press with no matching handler still reaches any `on_interaction` listener.

Answer within 15 minutes, in any of three ways; the member's button waits until you do, and shows an error if nothing comes back in about five seconds.
`await interaction.reply_ephemeral(text)` answers only the presser, three times at most per press, through the private-reply route with `interaction_id` in place of `in_reply_to_id` (the two are separate fields and one of them is required).
`await interaction.edit_components(rows(...))` replaces the buttons on the pressed message, for example with `disabled=True` ones, and `[]` clears them.
`await interaction.ack()` says the press needs no visible answer.
A handler that returns without answering is acked for you, so a quiet handler does not look broken; one that raises is not, so the member sees the failure.

`AsyncClient.send(components=...)`, `edit_components(channel_id, message_id, layout, interaction_id=...)` and `ack_interaction(channel_id, interaction_id)` are the underlying calls.
A press is best effort like typing: a bot that was offline never sees it.
`FakeAsyncClient` records replacements in `client.component_edits` and acks in `client.acks`, and a test can feed a press through `await bot._handle_frame({"type": "interaction.created", ...})`.

## Menu entries and call controls

`@bot.message_menu("translate", "Translate")` adds a row to every message's context menu, and `@bot.call_control("pause", "Pause", icon="pause")` adds a button to the call dock while the bot is on the call (slim-m decision 0045).
Members see menu rows under the bot's name and a Bot badge, after the app's own rows, so an entry cannot pass for a built-in one.
At most 5 menu entries and 8 call controls, a 32-character label and a 64-character id of letters, digits and `-_.`; the decorator refuses anything over.
A label may not hold a control, a text-direction mark or a character that draws nothing (the set in `slimbots/hidden_chars.py`, the same one the server uses), and the decorator refuses those too.
If the server still answers a registration (`PUT /bots/ui` or `PUT /bots/commands`) with a 400, the run logs the server's reason and exits with status 1 instead of reconnecting, because the same body would be refused every time.
`permission=Permissions.X` hides the entry from members without that bit and the server refuses their use of it, so unlike a command's permission it is enforced.
`icon` is for call controls and one of `play`, `pause`, `stop`, `skip_next`, `skip_previous`, `volume`, `volume_off`, `repeat`, `shuffle` or `list`.

The handler is the same as a button's: it gets an `Interaction` with `kind` (`message_menu` or `call_control`), the member (`user_id`, `user_display_name`) and, for a menu entry, the `message_id` it was used on.
A call control's `message_id` is `None` and `edit_components` raises on it.
A call control is used on a call, so it reaches the bot whatever `SLIMM_CHANNELS` says; only a message menu use and a button press are held to the channel scope.
Answer with `reply_ephemeral` or `ack`, within the same 15 minutes; a handler that returns quietly is acked for you.
The set is registered with `PUT /bots/ui` on every connect, only when the bot declares any, so a bot that removes its last entry keeps the old ones until it registers a set again.

## Sharing a watch position

`client.set_watch_session(channel_id, item_id=..., title=..., playing=..., position_ms=..., duration_ms=None, seeked=False, controller_user_id=None)`, `client.tick_watch_session(channel_id, playing=..., position_ms=...)`, `client.end_watch_session(channel_id)` and `client.get_watch_session(channel_id)` are the routes of slim-m decision 0050.
The writes need the bot on the call (join with `bot.voice.join` first), a tick about every 5 seconds is the session's heartbeat, and `seeked=True` moves the epoch so viewers re-read; the server's contract is in its `docs/bots/building-bots.md`.
None of the three retries on its own, because a retried write only deepens a 429 (the server allows a burst of 4, then one per 2 seconds); a 409 means another bot holds the channel.
`FakeAsyncClient` accepts all three writes and records them in `client.calls`.

## Embeds

`ctx.send(content, embed=Embed(...))` and `ctx.reply(...)` send the real `RequestEmbed` wire shape decision 0030 defines (title/description/url/color/author/fields/footer/timestamp/image/thumbnail), capped to the same limits the server enforces (10 embeds/message elsewhere is a bot's own concern; per-embed caps live in `slimbots/embeds.py`).
`content` is never sent blank - slim-m refuses that - so a bare `embed=` with no `content` sends the embed's own `render_fallback()` text alongside the real embed.
If the server rejects the request with `embeds` present (an older deployment), `AsyncClient.send` retries once, under the same message id, as plain fallback text - the one case `render_fallback()` is the whole reply rather than a companion to it.

## Testing

`slimbots.testing.FakeAsyncClient` never touches the network: pre-stubbed `/me`/`/channels`/`/members`/`/roles`, `respond(method, path, response_or_exception)` to stub anything else, and an unstubbed call fails loud rather than hanging.
Drive a `Bot` directly with `await bot.process_message({...})` to exercise argument conversion, cooldowns, permission gating, and the bot-ignore default with no deployment; `await bot._handle_frame({...})` reaches an `@bot.event` handler the same way.
A `wait_for`/`ctx.confirm` round trip needs `_handle_frame`, not `process_message` directly, since only `_handle_frame` schedules the command as its own background task the way the real gateway loop does; call it sequentially for each frame (command, then reply) with a short `await asyncio.sleep(0.01)` between them so the spawned task gets a turn to start and register its listener before the next frame arrives - `slimbots/tests/test_frame_loop_does_not_block_on_wait_for.py` and `bots/canvas-board/test_bot.py`'s `!board clear` tests are the worked examples.
`slimbots.testing.FakeVoice`/`FakeVoiceSession` stand in for `bot.voice`: `bot.voice = FakeVoice()`, then `await bot.voice.join(...)` hands back a session that records `publish_screen_share`'s arguments and whether `leave()` was called - no LiveKit package or network involved, which is also why CI never installs `livekit` (`bot-jellyfin`'s `test_bot.py` and `slimbots/tests/test_voice.py` are the worked examples).
It is not a mock of slim-m's own validation or concurrency - `bots/casino/test_concurrency.py` is what proves money-safety, with a real sqlite connection and real threads.

## Types

`slimbots` ships `py.typed` - an editor or a type checker on a bot script sees real signatures, not `Any` everywhere.
Coverage is real but not exhaustive: `Bot`, `Context`, `Command`/`Group`, `Space`, `Member`/`Channel`/`Role`/`Message`, `Embed`, `Canvas`, `Store`, and every typed event payload are fully annotated; a handful of internal helpers still lean on inference.
`pyright` (config in `pyproject.toml`, `basic` mode) runs in CI over the whole package and is the gate for this - a signature that quietly goes wrong (an `Optional` nobody narrowed, a param that no longer matches its caller) fails the same PR that introduced it, instead of surfacing as a runtime `AttributeError` in whoever's bot happens to hit that path first.

## Removed in 0.3.0

Every template in this repo is on `Bot`.
`Client`, `Connection`, `run_forever`, `call_with_retry`, `cursor.bootstrap`/`sync`, and `testing.FakeClient` - the pre-0.3 sync primitives a bot built by hand on top of - are gone rather than kept unused: `bot.py` for a ported bot no longer has two different ways to do the same thing to choose between.
`cursor.get`/`set`/`init_table` (plain sqlite, no network) and `client.socket_url` stayed, since `Bot` itself still uses them internally.
`bot-ping` never used any of this - it is still the one file that shows the whole protocol by hand, on purpose.
