# Changelog

All notable changes to `slim-m` (the `slimbots` package) are recorded here.
This project does not yet follow strict semantic versioning - it is pre-1.0, and a minor version can carry a breaking change, called out below.

## 0.11.0

- `@bot.call_control(..., options=[(id, label), ...])` registers a call control that opens a choice instead of firing, 2 to 8 options, and the pick arrives as `interaction.option_id`. It needs a slim-m server with migration 0100; an older one shows a plain button and `option_id` is `None`.
- `settings` (a gear) is one of the call control icons.
- `call_control` builds its entry when it is called, so a bad option set fails at the call rather than at the decorator.

## 0.10.0

- Breaking: `AuthorFilter` no longer takes `ignore_bots`. It was never read. `Bot(ignore_bots=...)` is unchanged.
- The catch-up after a restart opens the gateway first and holds live frames until the replay ends, so nothing that arrives during the replay is lost or applied out of order.
- `Store` runs on one worker thread and honours its timeout.
- Embeds and components are checked before they are sent, so a bad one fails in the bot with a clear error instead of as a 400 from the server.
- `Permissions.VIEW_MODERATION_HISTORY` is the server's bit, and `UiEntry` checks the permission it names.
- A failed audio publish takes the video track back down instead of leaving a silent share.
- The publish workflow pins its actions by sha and builds from a hash-locked requirements file.

## 0.9.7

- `publish_screen_share` takes `audio_queue_ms`, `video_codec` and `video_encoder`, each keeping the library default when left out. A short audio queue keeps the sound with the picture after a seek or pause; `video_codec="h264"` with `video_encoder="nvenc"` encodes on an nvidia gpu when the container has one.
- `FakeAudioSource.clear_queue()` matches the real source, so a bot that clears its audio on a restart can be tested.
- `bot-jellyfin` needs `slim-m>=0.9.7` for the above; `scripts/check_bot_pr.py` enforces it. Its own fixes ride along in the template: a seek or stop no longer hangs on python 3.12, the picture no longer runs ahead of the sound, films play at their own frame rate, Jellyfin sends stereo instead of 5.1, and one ffmpeg feeds both tracks.

## 0.9.6

- The catch-up after a restart pages through `/sync` instead of stopping at one page, so a bot that was down through a busy stretch replays everything it missed, and a scope the server resets jumps to the latest message instead of replaying old history.
- `role.changed` and `member.role_changed` frames refresh a bot's cached permissions (`Space.reapply_roles`), so a role change no longer needs a restart to take effect.
- `Store.run` rolls back a transaction left open when the function it runs raises, so the next run does not fail on a dangling transaction.

## 0.9.5

- `publish_screen_share` publishes without simulcast by default, with `simulcast=True` to ask for it. livekit defaulted it on, and a screen share's low layer runs at 3 fps, so a small tile at 1080p got a slideshow.
- `bot-jellyfin` publishes 1080p class sizes at 1920x1072, under libwebrtc's 8 thread vp8 cutoff, which takes one 1080p stream from about 1.8 cores to about 0.7.

## 0.9.4

- `AsyncClient.get_watch_session`, `set_watch_session`, `tick_watch_session` and `end_watch_session` talk to the server's durable watch session. The writes do not retry on their own: the server allows a burst of 4 then one write per 2 seconds, and a retried write only deepens a 429.
- Call controls reach a channel-scoped bot whatever `SLIMM_CHANNELS` and `SLIMM_LISTEN_VOICE_CHATS` say; message menu uses and button presses are still held to the channel scope.
- `UiEntry` refuses a label made of or containing invisible or direction-changing characters, using the same set as the server, and a 400 from `PUT /bots/ui` or `PUT /bots/commands` ends the run with the server's reason instead of retrying for ever.
- `bot-jellyfin` posts the watch session and its ticks. Bots that use any of this need `slim-m>=0.9.4`; `scripts/check_bot_pr.py` enforces it.

## 0.9.3

- `ctx.reply_ephemeral` and `interaction.reply_ephemeral` take `embed=` and `attachment_ids=`, and `AsyncClient.send_ephemeral` and `send_ephemeral_to_press` take `embeds=` and `attachment_ids=`.
  An attachment must already be fetchable by the bot and the member.
- Bots that use them need `slim-m>=0.9.3`; `scripts/check_bot_pr.py` enforces it.

## 0.9.2

- `Bot.moderation_head` is the `moderation_seq` the server's `hello` carried on the current connection, or `None` when the server sent none. It is set before `on_ready`.
- `Gateway.hello` keeps the whole hello frame.
- Bots that use it need `slim-m>=0.9.2`; `scripts/check_bot_pr.py` enforces it.
- `bot-modlog` persists the largest moderation `seq` it has seen, compares it with the head on each reconnect, and logs a gap marker when the head is still ahead after a short wait, attributed to a server restart when `/version` changed since its last connect.

## 0.9.1

- `Member.joined_at` is the server's account creation time in Unix milliseconds, or `None` when the payload has none. Since one deployment is one community, it is the join time.
- Bots that use it need `slim-m>=0.9.1`; `scripts/check_bot_pr.py` enforces it.

## 0.9.0

- `AsyncClient.get_message(channel_id, message_id)` and `Message.fetch(client, channel_id, message_id)` read one message by id, even one the bot never saw live.
  A channel the bot cannot view answers the same 404 as a missing message.
- `Message.attachments` is a list of `Attachment`, so a bot can pass their ids to `send(attachment_ids=...)`.
- `Channel.restricted` is `True` when `@everyone` cannot view the channel, and `None` when the server did not send it.
- Bots that use these need `slim-m>=0.9.0`; `scripts/check_bot_pr.py` enforces it.
- `bot-starboard` fetches a message it never saw, mirrors attachments, never mirrors a bot's or webhook's message, and will not mirror a possibly restricted channel into a public highlights channel.

## 0.8.0

- `space.find_member(user_id)` returns the cached member, else fetches it once, else `None`. `Bot._resolve_author` uses it.
- `bot.setting(name, type=bool)` and `type=dict` (`"a:1,b:2"`, order kept). A malformed dict entry is reported at `start()` with the missing-setting errors.
- `VoiceSession.leave` logs a warning when forgetting the heartbeat fails, instead of swallowing it.
- Bots that use these need `slim-m>=0.8.0`; `scripts/check_bot_pr.py` enforces it.
- Fix: `bot-jellyfin` announced the same episode or movie again when Sonarr or a manual replace swapped the file, since the new Jellyfin item has a new id and `DateCreated`. Announcements are now deduped in the bot's sqlite by series/season/episode, and by tmdb/imdb id or name and year for movies, within `JELLYFIN_DEDUPE_DAYS` (default 7, `0` is off). `JELLYFIN_REANNOUNCE_REPLACED=true` restores the old behaviour. The new `posted_media` table is added in place to an existing database.

## 0.7.1

- Fix: a bot with `listen_voice_chats` never heard a voice channel created, or made visible to it, after it connected. `space.channels` was only loaded on connect.
- `space.channels` now follows `channel.created`, `channel.updated` and `channel.deleted`, and is reloaded on `overwrite.changed`, `role.changed` and the bot's own `member.role_changed`, since those can make a channel newly visible.
- A frame for a channel id the space does not know triggers one channel reload, at most once per id per 30 seconds, as a backstop.
- A frame dropped because the bot does not listen in its channel is logged at debug level on the `slimbots.bot` logger.
- `Space.apply_channel_frame(frame)` is new.

## 0.7.0

Menu entries and call controls expect a slim-m server with bot-contributed UI (decision 0045, which stacks on decision 0039).

- New `@bot.message_menu(id, label, permission=None)`: adds a row to every message's context menu, under the bot's name and badge. The handler gets the same `Interaction` as a button, with `kind == "message_menu"` and the `message_id` it was used on.
- New `@bot.call_control(id, label, icon=None, permission=None)`: adds a button to the call dock while the bot is on the call. `icon` is one of `play`, `pause`, `stop`, `skip_next`, `skip_previous`, `volume`, `volume_off`, `repeat`, `shuffle`, `list`. The `Interaction` has `kind == "call_control"` and a `message_id` of `None`.
- The caps are the server's: 5 menu entries, 8 call controls, a 32-character label and a 64-character id. They are checked when the decorator runs.
- Both are registered with `PUT /bots/ui` on connect, only when the bot declares any, and quietly skipped on a server that predates it.
- `Interaction.kind` is new (`button` on a server that does not send it). `reply_ephemeral` and `ack` answer a use as they do a press; `edit_components` raises on a call control.
- `FakeAsyncClient` answers `PUT /bots/ui`, and `client.calls` records it.

## 0.6.0

Ephemeral replies expect a slim-m server with ephemeral messages (decision 0036).

- New `AsyncClient.time_out_member(user_id, duration_seconds, reason=None)` and `lift_member_timeout(user_id)`: put a member in timeout, or take them out of it. The bot needs the moderation permission; a missing one surfaces as the server's error.
- `FakeClient` records both calls, so a bot's tests can assert on them.
- `bot-automod` uses them.
- New `ctx.reply_ephemeral(text)` and `AsyncClient.send_ephemeral(channel_id, in_reply_to_id, text)`: answer only the author of a message, marked "Only you can see this". Never stored, so it is gone on reload and never reaches an offline member.
- `reply_ephemeral(..., public_fallback=True)` replies in the channel instead on a server that predates it (404/405). A 403 always raises.
- `FakeAsyncClient` records private answers in `client.ephemerals`, apart from `client.sent`.
- `bot-greeter` refuses `!welcome here` privately.
- New buttons on messages: `Button`, `rows()` and `send(components=...)`, with `@bot.button(custom_id)` / `@bot.button(prefix=...)` handlers that receive an `Interaction` naming who pressed. Expects the server's buttons support (decision 0039, which stacks on decision 0037).
- `Interaction.reply_ephemeral`, `.edit_components` and `.ack` answer a press; a handler that returns quietly is acked for it. `AsyncClient` gains `edit_components`, `ack_interaction` and `send_ephemeral_to_press`.
- `FakeAsyncClient` records `component_edits` and `acks`.

## 0.5.1

- New `VoiceSession.unpublish_screen_share()`: takes down the pair `publish_screen_share` published, so a bot can republish at another resolution or ceiling (a `VideoSource`'s size is fixed at construction). Safe to call twice.
- `FakeVoiceSession` gains `publish_count`/`unpublish_count` and the matching `unpublish_screen_share()`.
- `bot-jellyfin` uses it for `!quality <low|medium|high>`.

## 0.5.0

Two ways to scope where and how a bot answers, from one owner report: `!watch` typed in a voice channel's chat went unanswered, and every bot answering `!help` in a shared channel is a mess.

- Cause of the unanswered voice chat: a voice channel's chat is an ordinary channel of its own, and the server delivers its `message.created` to any bot that can view it. `Bot._handle_frame` then dropped the frame because the channel id was not in `channels` (`SLIMM_CHANNELS`, which names the text channel). Nothing on the server was wrong.
- New `Bot(listen_voice_chats=True)`, or `SLIMM_LISTEN_VOICE_CHATS=1`: a scoped bot also accepts messages (and channel events) from any voice channel's chat. Off by default, so existing bots are unchanged. `bot-jellyfin` turns it on.
- New `SLIMM_PREFIX`: overrides the `prefix=` a script passes, so an operator can give each bot in a shared channel its own without a code change. The default is still whatever the script passes (`!` in every template).
- New `Bot(mention_commands=True)` (the default): `@username <command>` runs a command exactly like the prefix does, case-insensitively, and only for this bot's own name. Pass `False` to keep the old prefix-only behaviour.
- `help` now opens with the bot's name and both ways to call it, for example `**jellyfin commands** (prefix `!`, or `@jellyfin <command>`)`, so several bots answering one channel can be told apart. `Bot.username` is set from `/me` on connect; before that the old header is used.
- A voice channel created after the bot connects is only recognised after its next reconnect, because `Space.channels` is refreshed on connect.

## 0.4.4

A prod bug: `!watch` failed with `module 'livekit.rtc' has no attribute 'AudioEncoding'`. 0.4.3's audio-bitrate ceiling called `rtc.AudioEncoding(...)`, but real livekit (1.1.20) re-exports `VideoEncoding` on `rtc` and not `AudioEncoding` - it lives only in the proto. The test fake had defined an `AudioEncoding` the real library does not, so the suite was green while every watch party threw.

- `publish_screen_share` now resolves `AudioEncoding` via the public name when present and falls back to `livekit.rtc._proto.room_pb2.AudioEncoding` otherwise; video was already correct.
- The `fake_rtc_module` no longer provides `AudioEncoding`, matching the real surface, and a new test drives the fallback branch so the old `rtc.AudioEncoding` shape cannot come back green.

## 0.4.3

`VoiceSession.publish_screen_share` now takes optional encoding ceilings, so a bot that publishes video is no longer stuck with the library default's ~1200 kbps floor and no ceiling.

- New `video_max_bitrate`, `video_max_framerate` and `audio_max_bitrate` kwargs, each `None` by default so existing callers are unchanged; when set they reach the LiveKit track as `VideoEncoding` / `AudioEncoding`.
- `bot-jellyfin`'s watch party uses them to match the WebRTC ceiling to Jellyfin's own transcode rather than letting the decent transcode be re-encoded back down, and to give continuous movie audio a 128 kbps stereo default instead of the unset speech-call tuning.
- `FakeVoiceSession` records the new kwargs, so a bot's tests can assert what it asked for.

## 0.4.2

A prod bug: `!watch iron man` gave the numbered picker, a reply within seconds still timed out 60s later with "timed out - `!watch` again to retry".

- `Bot._handle_frame` used to await `process_message` inline, so the single sequential gateway loop (`async for frame in gateway.frames(): await self._handle_frame(frame)`) was blocked for as long as a command ran - including inside a command's own `bot.wait_for`/`ctx.confirm`. The reply frame that would resolve the wait could never be read until the wait's own timeout fired: a deadlock, not a race, for every command that waits on a later message.
- `_handle_frame` now runs `process_message` as its own `bot.background()` task instead, so the frame loop keeps reading while a command is still in progress. Task creation order still matches frame arrival order; completion order does not (a slower command can finish after a faster later one) - a per-channel queue was considered and rejected, since serializing to completion would reintroduce the same deadlock one level down for a reply in the same channel.
- Confirmed `ctx.confirm` and `bot-canvas-board`'s `!board clear` hit the identical deadlock and are fixed by the same change; both had test-level workarounds that existed only to dodge it.
- Confirmed the picker's `same_place` check (`message.get("channel_id")`/`message.get("author_id")`) against the real wire `MessageDto` - both are genuine top-level fields, no fix needed there.
- New regression test drives `_handle_frame` sequentially, the way the real gateway does, instead of calling `process_message` directly - the old tests could not have caught this since they never exercised the frame loop itself.

## 0.4.1

`!watch` required the invoker to be in the *command channel's* own voice call - a check that could never pass once `!watch` was typed in an ordinary text channel, since a text channel has no voice call of its own. The bot always replied "join this channel's voice call first," regardless of which real voice channel the person was actually in.

- `bot.voice.find_member(user_id)`: the voice channel a member is actually connected to, or None - live `voice.participant_joined`/`voice.participant_left` events (decision 0032) update an in-memory cache, a cache miss falls back to a concurrent roster scan of every voice channel the bot can see.
- `bot-jellyfin`'s `!watch` now joins the invoker's real voice channel, wherever the command was typed; refuses with "join a voice channel first, then run `!watch` again" only if they are in no call, and names the missing `CONNECT`/`SPEAK` permission if the bot can't join or can't speak there. The confirmation names the voice channel, e.g. "streaming Iron Man into #voice".
- Audited every other bot for the same "the command's channel is where the action happens" assumption; `bot-canvas-board` already has an explicit `CANVAS_CHANNEL` (0.4.0), and the rest (`bot-casino`, `bot-reminders`, `bot-modlog`, `bot-roles`) legitimately act on the channel a command came from - no other bot needed a change.

## 0.4.0

A 0.2.0 database carried over into 0.3.0 could crash on a column that only 0.3.0's schema added - `bot-canvas-board`'s `items.added_by` was the one that actually broke in production (`OperationalError: no such column: added_by`).

- `slimbots.migrations.ensure_columns(conn, table, columns)`: a small library helper that adds a missing column to an existing table, idempotently, so a bot's `init_db` does not have to hand-roll it.
- `bot-canvas-board` now migrates `items.added_by` for a database carried over from 0.2.0.
- `bot-casino` now migrates its `hands` table's `hand_index`/`status` columns *and* rebuilds the table to widen its primary key, which a plain `ALTER TABLE` cannot do - a 0.2.0 database's in-progress hand is carried over as `hand_index = 0`.
- `bot-reminders`' existing hand-rolled `_ensure_column` is now `ensure_columns`, the shared helper, instead of a bot-local copy.
- Audited every other bot's schema against what 0.2.0 created; `bot-jellyfin` and `bot-modlog` had no drift to migrate.
- `bot.canvas(channel_id)`: a `Canvas` wired with the bot's own client and gateway, for a bot that draws on a channel other than the one a command came from.
- `bot-canvas-board` takes `!board` commands from an ordinary text channel and draws on a separately configured voice channel's canvas, via a new `CANVAS_CHANNEL` setting - backward compatible with the old single-channel setup, which now logs a startup warning instead of silently staying implicit.
- `bot.voice.join(channel_id)`: joins a voice call over LiveKit, keeping a heartbeat running in the background so the server's 40s heartbeat timeout doesn't evict it; `VoiceSession.publish_screen_share()` publishes a video+audio pair tagged as a screen share, rendered by a client with no bot-specific code on that end. `livekit.rtc` loads through `importlib` rather than a normal import, so a bot that never touches voice - and CI - never needs the package installed.
- `bot-jellyfin` gets a watch party: `!watch <title>`, `!pause`, `!resume`, `!seek <h:mm:ss>`, `!np`, `!subs <lang|off>`, `!stop` - jellyfin transcodes server-side, a local ffmpeg decodes that into raw frames pushed into the source `bot.voice` hands back.
- `slimbots.testing.FakeVoice`/`FakeVoiceSession` stand in for the real LiveKit connection so a bot's voice-touching tests never need `livekit`/`ffmpeg` installed.

## 0.3.0

The framework rewrite: `Bot()`, `@bot.command`/`@bot.group()`, typed argument conversion, `ctx`, a live `Space`/`Canvas` model, `bot.setting()`, `bot.background()`, and real embeds.
Every bot template in [slim-bots](https://github.com/NC1107/slim-bots) is on it now.
See `docs/framework.md` for the full shape.

### Removed

The pre-0.3 sync primitives every template used to hand-roll around are gone, not deprecated - a bot on 0.2.0 needs to move onto `Bot` to upgrade, not just bump a pin.

| 0.2.0 | 0.3.0 |
| --- | --- |
| `Client` (sync, urllib-based REST + auth) | `Bot` owns auth and connection; use `bot.client` (an `AsyncClient`, httpx-based) for a raw call |
| `Connection` (sync websocket handshake) | `Bot` owns the connection; `@bot.event`/`@bot.command` replace reading frames by hand |
| `run_forever` (the reconnect loop) | `bot.run()` / `await bot.start()` |
| `call_with_retry` | `AsyncClient.call`'s own built-in retry (a network error, a 5xx, or a 429; never a rejected 4xx) |
| `cursor.bootstrap` / `cursor.sync` (sync) | `catchup.bootstrap` / `catchup.sync` (async), or nothing - `Bot(channels=...)` catches up automatically on connect |
| `testing.FakeClient` | `testing.FakeAsyncClient` |

`cursor.get`/`set`/`init_table` (plain sqlite, no network) and `client.socket_url` are unchanged - `Bot` still uses both internally.

### Added

- `Bot()`, `@bot.command`, `@bot.group()`/`@group.command()`, `ctx.reply`/`ctx.send`
- Typed argument conversion: `int`, `float`, `Member`, `Duration`, `TimeOfDay`
- `bot.space` (members/channels/roles) and `bot.space.grant_role`/`revoke_role`
- `Canvas` for a channel's Voice Canvas (`place`/`move`/`remove`/`viewport`)
- `bot.setting()` for a bot's own env vars, reported alongside a missing `SLIMM_URL`/token/channels
- `bot.data_path`, `bot.background()` for a supervised task that outlives one command
- Real embeds (`Embed`), with a markdown fallback for a server that does not know the field yet
- Command registration with the server (`PUT /bots/commands`), a no-op against a server too old to have the route
- Built-in safeguards: bot/webhook ignore, per-command cooldowns (per user, per channel, or per deployment via `cooldown_bucket=`), permission gates against the caller's real permissions, 429 backoff, 401 as terminal, clean SIGTERM shutdown
- Typed `on_*` dispatch for every websocket frame kind, not just the original eight (`slimbots.events`)
- Typed REST wrappers: `Message.edit`/`.delete`/`.react`, reactions, pins, threads, polls, attachment upload, DMs
- `Canvas.clear`/`.restore`/`.reorder`, alongside the existing `place`/`move`/`remove`/`viewport`
- A gateway send path: `ctx.typing()`, `canvas.send_cursor()`, `canvas.send_stroke_preview()`
- `bot.wait_for(event, check=, timeout=)` and `ctx.confirm(prompt)`
- `on_command_not_found(ctx, error)`, dispatched only when a bot actually listens for it
- `bot.load_extension(module)` to split a bot across files
- `py.typed` and real type hints on the public surface, checked by `pyright` in CI

## 0.2.0 and earlier

Pre-framework: `Client`, `Connection`, `run_forever`, `cursor`, `testing.FakeClient`. Each bot template implemented its own command parsing, member lookup, and reconnect handling on top of these.
